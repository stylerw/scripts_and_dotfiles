## Will's Script and Dotfile Repository

A set of shell scripts, dotfiles, and configurations which I use and want to share.

### python_scripts

- **tipafy.py**: This script [converts Unicode IPA into TIPA](https://wstyler.ucsd.edu/posts/unicode_to_tipa.html). You should use XeLaTeX and native unicode rather than doing this, but it's a useful hack.


### shell_scripts

- **gen_slides_docs_letters.sh**: This is a script which automatically generates my slides, documents, letters of recommendation, and more.
